/**
 * An IncQuery incremental evaluation engine, attached to a model such as an EMF resource. The engine hosts pattern matchers, and
 * will listen on model update notifications stemming from the given model in order to maintain live results.
 * 
 * <p>
 * By default, IncQueryEngines do not need to be separately disposed; they will be garbage collected along with the model. 
 * Advanced users: see {@link AdvancedIncQueryEngine} if you want fine control over the lifecycle of an engine.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Pattern matchers within this engine may be instantiated in the following ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Recommended: instantiate the specific matcher class generated for the pattern by e.g. MyPatternMatcher.on(engine).
 * <li>Use {@link #getMatcher(IQuerySpecification)} if the pattern-specific generated matcher API is not available.
 * <li>Advanced: use the query specification associated with the generated matcher class to achieve the same.
 * </ul>
 * Additionally, a group of patterns (see {@link IQueryGroup}) can be initialized together before usage; this may improve
 * the performance of pattern matcher construction by trying to gather all necessary information from the model in one go. 
 * Note that no such improvement is to be expected if the engine is specifically constructed in wildcard mode, 
 * an option available in some scope implementations  
 * (see {@link EMFScope#EMFScope(Notifier, BaseIndexOptions)} and {@link BaseIndexOptions#withWildcardMode(boolean)}).
